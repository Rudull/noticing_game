## Description

**Noticing Game** is an innovative browser extension that transforms YouTube into an interactive language learning tool. It automatically analyzes video subtitles in real time, highlights words from customizable frequency lists, and turns vocabulary practice into a fun, engaging game.
Whether you're a language learner, teacher, or simply curious about the vocabulary used in videos, Noticing Game helps you notice, track, and master the most important words as you watch.

- Instantly see which frequent words appear in any video
- Play by clicking words as you notice them in the subtitles
- Track your progress and challenge yourself to improve

Unlock a new way to learn languagesâ€”directly on YouTube!

## How It Works

Noticing Game consists of two parts:

1. **Chrome Extension:**
   Provides the interactive game and analyzes subtitles on YouTube.

2. **Backend Subtitle Server:**
   A small Python server that extracts subtitles from YouTube videos using `yt-dlp` and provides them to the extension.

> **Note:** The backend server is required for full functionality.
> For installation and advanced usage, see [`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md) and [`backend/README_BUILD.md`](backend/README_BUILD.md).
